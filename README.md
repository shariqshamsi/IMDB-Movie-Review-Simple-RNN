# Features
- **Custom-trained Simple-RNN model:** Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model created and trained using TensorFlow on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **Pre-trained model deployment:** Uses the trained RNN model for real-time sentiment predictions.
- **Streamlit UI:** Provides a clean and interactive interface for users to input and classify reviews.
- **Real-time predictions:** Instant sentiment predictions with a confidence score.

# Usage
-  Launch the app using Streamlit.
- Enter a movie review in the text box.
